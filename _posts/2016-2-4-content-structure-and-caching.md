title: Content Structure and Caching
---

Every piece of content displayed on a web application page can be split into two groups from the perspective of a visitor: _visitor-specific_ and _shared_.

_Shared_ content should be cached on edge servers or pre-generated on the web server. 

_Visitor-specific_ content should be rendered in the browser.
